This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potentially problematic Elixir code snippet. The `bug.exs` file contains code that uses `Enum.each` and `Process.exit` within the anonymous function which causes premature termination. This might not be immediately obvious and could lead to harder-to-debug issues in larger applications. The `bugSolution.exs` file offers a corrected version using a more appropriate approach.
